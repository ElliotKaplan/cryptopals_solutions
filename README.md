# Cryptopals solutions

These are solutions to the various challenges found at
https://cryptopals.com in various languages. These have all been done
to death by a million people in a million repositories, but the
intention here is to teach myself a wee bit of crypto, and how to
write in various languages. If I need some sort of coding sample
somewhere down the line, this should provide some evidence of
competence.
